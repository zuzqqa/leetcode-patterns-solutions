# leetcode-patterns-solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems grouped by common algorithmic patterns, inspired by [Sean Pashard's LeetCode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/). Each folder represents a specific pattern and contains problems that can be solved using that approach.

## Patterns
- [Arrays](https://github.com/zuzqqa/leetcode-patterns-solutions/tree/main/arrays)
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Backtracking
- Binary Search
- Bit Manipulation
- Bucket Sort
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Design
- Dynamic Programming
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Graph
- Greedy
- Heap
- In-place reversal of a linked list
- Intervals
- QuickSelect
- Sliding Window
- Sorting
- Topological Sort
- Trie
- [Two Pointers](https://github.com/zuzqqa/leetcode-patterns-solutions/tree/main/two%20pointers)
- Union Find
